                "I recently stayed at Mystique Villa in Ooty, and it was an
                unforgettable experience. The hotel offers breathtaking views,
                surrounded by lush greenery and the soothing presence of a
                nearby waterfall, which can be seen right from the room, It’s
                the perfect place to connect with nature.

                need to come down by crossing 15 hairpin curves which was a
                great feeling. This place is marvellous with breath taking
                views, lush garden, greenary, fresh air, great food, good staff,
                and waterfall view.

                We stayed here for 3 days and we enjoyed each and every moment

                went a treak to nearby waterfalls. Looking forward to visit this
